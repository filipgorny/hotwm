1. hotwm is inspired by emacs, i3 and dwm.
2. it will support Lua scripting language.
3. it is mixed tilling and floating window manager
	- tilling layouts are designed with a grid system
4. Most of the functions are run by a command, that user can type
into the dmenu like/or gnome overview like input field.
5. The distribution of hotwm includes a dockbar, that is a separate
process. All wm processes are run by the launcher process.
6.The source code needs to be clean, easy to understand and easy
to modify.
7. The overall design should follow the philosophy of "zen-like"
approach, keeping the user not to be distracted by thing he doesn't 
need at the moment.
8. The goal of the project's usability is to allow control by using
just a keyboard.
