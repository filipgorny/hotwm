# HotWM
HotWM is a X11 window manager, that tries to be modern, focused on a productivity option on the current window managers arena.

The other goal is to keep the source code as easy to modify as it can be, keeping it readable, well organized and described.

This software is under heavy development and it is **not ready** to use yet.

## Contribution
I am very open to code it together, with everyone interested.

## Licence
This software is distributed under the GPL licence.
